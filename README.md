# md-to-cubari

A simple Manifest V2 extension that redirects links from MangaDex manga and chapter pages to cubari.moe 

## How to use it

For the redirect to work you need to click on a MangaDex manga (with "/title/" on its path) or chapter (with "/chapter/" on its path) link from ***outside*** MangaDex itself. If you're on mangadex.org and click on a manga or chapter, the redirect won't work. This is because MangaDex is a SSR app made in Nuxt. When clicking on links from within a SSR app you're (most of the time) not actually *going* to another page; the site just updates the current one with new information.
